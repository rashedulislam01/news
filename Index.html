<p><b>Bourse braces for its biggest IPO yet</b> 
    
Robi is set to come up with the country's biggest-ever initial public offering yet within a couple of months, in what can be viewed as finally some good news for the depressed bourse.

The second-largest mobile phone carrier intends to raise Tk 523.79 crore from the market.

The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has almost completed the scrutiny of the floatation proposal and is planning to approve the listing proposal within the next couple of months.

Some 10 per cent, or about 52.38 crore, shares would be offloaded, according to the application, which was submitted on March 2. The face-value will be Tk 10 and there will be no premium.

Prof Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam, the newly appointed chairman of the BSEC, said though the previous commission scrutinised Robi's application it was quite easy for the new commission to give its seal of approval.

"But the new commission has decided to go for a second scrutiny. We are very positive about Robi's enrolment and hope to accept it within the next couple of months," he said.

Robi's listing would help bring the market to a lucrative shape, he said.</p>&nbsp;

<p><b>‘No fear of Bangladesh cricket being isolated’</b>
Recently a fear has emerged that Bangladesh may not feature high on the International Cricket Council’s (ICC’s) priorities in the post-pandemic world because of the powerful member countries’ commercial interests as they inevitably try to recoup losses incurred during the halt in play.</p>&nbsp;
